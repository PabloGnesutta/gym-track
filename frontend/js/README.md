NOTES:
When working locally, set the INTERCEPT_FETCH_REQUESTS to false in cacheServiceWorker.js.
This way you can see your changes impacted when hot reloading. Otherwise you would see always the same: whatever is cached.

Before releasing, update the necessary cache version numbers and have this flag set to true.
